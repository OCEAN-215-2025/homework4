    "    \n",
    "### Submitting to GradeScope\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your code fully runs before uploading to Gradescope. The best way to do this is by restarting your kernel, running through each of your cells, and checking for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you're sure that your code fully runs, save your notebook file. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your notebook file to your local computer by right clicking the file in the left panel. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Go to the Homework 4 Assignment in Gradescope and upload your file. You can resubmit as many times as you want before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working in your Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions to each question and its subsections carefully, and make sure to write your answers in the *specified area*. Typically, you will see a comment indicating where you should put your solutions. You are welcome to insert however many blocks of code below the starting block to complete your task\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes starter code are provided to you. In general, *unless stated otherwise*, you are welcomed to (and sometimes required to!) modify the content of the starter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make sure you follow the coding etiquette, since part of your grade is based on it.** As a reminder, you should (i) use meaningful variable names, (ii) organize your codes into logical blocks, and (iii) document the intent of your code. On average, we expects you to have a line of comment every 5 - 15 lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data files\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment requires you to load data from the provided data file(s). You should make sure that the location of each data file relative to your notebook is **exactly the same** as on the GitHub repo. For example, if the data files are contained in a folder named \"data\" at the same level as the notebook on GitHub, it should also be placed in a \"data\" folder at the same level as the notebook on JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is sufficient to include only the Jupyter notebook when you submit your homework to gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honor Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the assignment by writing and executing text and code cells as specified. For this assignment, do not use any features of Python that have not yet been discussed in the lessons or class sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please keep in mind our regrade request and dropped homework grading policy. Late assignments are not accepted. Review the syllabus for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can acknowledge and describe any assistance you've received on this assignment in the specified cell of the HW1 notebook, whether that was from an instructor, classmate (either directly or on Ed Discussion), and/or online resources. Alternatively, if you prefer, you may acknowledge assistance at the relevant point(s) in your code using a Python comment (#). Don't forget that you can receive extra credit from answering at least one question on Ed Discussion!"
